                            <h3>My experience making this project</h3>
                            <p>
                                This was the first publicly available game that I created. It was made for a game jam in under 72 hours. 
                                As it was my first complete game, there was a lot I had to learn so it could be in a playable state. First 
                                I had to learn about scene management so that the player could switch between the menu and the different 
                                levels. I also had to learn about optimization so that people could play it without lag, as well as learn 
                                about how to actually package up the game so it could be distributed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When it came to adding crops for the game, I had to learn about Scriptable Objects. To do this, I created 
                                a Crop object which you could then create in the assets folder. You could then give each crop object a 
                                different name, growth time, and sprites for each growth stage. This would then allow me to put any crop 
                                into a crop plot and use the same code for growing and harvesting the crop.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I also had to learn about basic enemy AI. This is because we wanted the player to have to sneak around 
                                other farms and burn them down. So I made a couple of states for the enemy AI; patrolling and chasing. If 
                                the enemy AI state was patrolling, it would walk along a set path so that the player could anticipate their 
                                movement. If they were chasing then they would move straight towards the player. In order to switch between 
                                the two, I added a vision cone that would detect the player. If the player was inside this vision cone then 
                                the AI would begin chasing the player. If the AI had not seen the player in a set amount of seconds, they 
                                would go back to patrolling.
                            </p>
