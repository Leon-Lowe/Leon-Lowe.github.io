                            <ul>
                                <li>Fast paced environment - Sort the parcels as fast as you can, but remember to empty 
                                    the parcel bins!
                                </li>
                                <li>Responsive Movement - In a fast paced game like this, you want the character to move as 
                                    soon as you tell it to.

                            <h3>My experience making this project</h3>
                            <p>
                                As this game was made for a game jam, I didn't have much time to explore anything out of my comfort 
                                zone. I did try to learn some new things in the unity physics package while I was creating this 
                                though. I had to do this as I needed to find a way of deciding which object the player was trying to 
                                interact with.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To do this, I first had to cast an OverlapCircle on the player and then return all the 
                                interactable objects that were within that circle. If the number of objects in the range was one, 
                                I could just interact with that object. However, if there were two or more objects in range, I then 
                                had to loop through them all and perform a raycast from the player to the current object being checked, 
                                all while storing the distance of the current closest one. This is also how I learnt about a cool float 
                                function called "float.maxValue".
                            </p>
