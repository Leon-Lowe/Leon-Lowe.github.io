                            <h3>My experience making this project</h3>
                            <p>
                                For this game jam project, we decided to push ourselves in each field we were working in. For me, this meant adding 
                                different dimensions you can switch between to solve puzzles and get past obstacles. I also had to learn how to use 
                                the post-processing package in unity as well as lights.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For the dimension switching, it was rather easy. I just had a script set up that would get all the objects from each 
                                dimension (normal, green, red, and blue) and then when the player switched the rune they were holding, it would go 
                                through and deactivate all dimension objects that we're not relevant to that dimension. To figure out what objects 
                                were part of what dimension, they had a simple script attached to them called DimensionObject that had an enum where 
                                you could choose the dimension for that object. This would then automatically update what sprite and emissive map the 
                                current object was using. I then had to make sure the camera switched the post-processing profile it was using so that 
                                each dimension would look unique.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As for the post-processing and lights, it was fairly straightforward to set up and implement. The tricky thing was 
                                optimizing the lights. To do this, I made a script that would only render the lights that were visible to the camera. 
                                Again, fairly easy to set up as the script would get all the lights in the scene on startup and then activate or 
                                deactivate the lights based on a distance calculated at startup based on your screen height and width.
                            </p>
