                            <h3>My experience making this project</h3>
                            <p>
                                During my time programming this game, I was brought out of my comfort zone 
                                quite a bit and pushed to learn new things. The end goal was to have our main 
                                story mode that focused on puzzle solving, and a time trial mode that focused 
                                on the movement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For the puzzle creation, I had to make a nice modular way of creating different 
                                puzzles. As most of the puzzles involved pressing buttons or pulling levers, I 
                                could make the button and lever classes extend from an interface. This interface 
                                would then interact with another interface that handled what other objects would 
                                do in response to this. For example, a button would extend IPuzzleInteractable 
                                which would then call the function Interact. This function would then tell all 
                                the IPuzzleComponent interfaces that they can call their function, Activate. I 
                                would then create something like a moving platform which would extend 
                                IPuzzleComponent and would start moving when Activate is called. This system 
                                meant that whoever was designing a level could put a button into the scene and 
                                then hook up the correct things that are affected by that button.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As for the movement, I usually set the players' velocity through code. However, 
                                that wouldn't work for the movement as we needed the speed to increase as you 
                                grappled. To do this, I had to add a force to the player whenever they were moving 
                                and grappling, and then cap the velocity at a certain point so the player couldn't 
                                move too fast.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One interesting thing I did have to learn how to do was the time trial logic. 
                                The player would be up against their previous time, and that also meant adding 
                                a ghost to show the previous run they did. I then had to store all of this in a file 
                                and then the player could share their ghost with their friends. All their friend 
                                had to do was delete their ghost file and add the new one. Sadly, we never released 
                                this as an update for the demo but I am planning on making a time trial-focused 
                                platformer soon to show off this feature.
                            </p>
