                            <h3>My experience making this project</h3>
                            <p>
                                For this python project, I mainly wanted to focus on separating my code into different files as well as creating components that could be 
                                added to objects and creating an easy way to load assets into the game.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To separate my code into different files, all I had to do was make sure I was importing the correct files into other files. For 
                                example, the 'main.py' file only needed to import the 'game.py' file. However, 'game.py' had to import:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>resources.py</li>
                                <li>player.py</li>
                                <li>enemy_cluster.py</li>
                                <li>mathematics.py</li>
                                <li>enemy.py</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                When it came to creating components that could be added, I had two in mind. The first was a 'transform' component which contained 
                                a vector2 for position and another vector2 for scale. It also had a function for moving the object it's attached to which just 
                                adds a given vector2 to its current position. The second component I wanted to create was a box collider. This needed a vector2 
                                for its position and an integer for its size in pixels. It then had a function for checking a collision between this box collider's 
                                position against another box collider's position.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The last thing I wanted to add was an easy way to put assets into the game. I did this by creating a class called resources that was 
                                created at the start of the game class. You would then be able to get any asset you wanted from it by calling something like 
                                'resources.PLAYER_SPRITE_PATH'. This meant that if you wanted to adjust a resource in your project, you wouldn't need to go through 
                                the entire project. You could just go to the asset file and change the sprite path.
                            </p>
