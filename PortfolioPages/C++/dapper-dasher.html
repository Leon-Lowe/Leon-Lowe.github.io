                            <p>
                                This game has a very simple premise: it was a side scroller where you had to jump over obstacles that came your way and get to the finish line.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While this game is very simple, it was a brilliant next step as the complexity of the programming was brought up but not to the point where 
                                I was lost. Learning about handling collision was made even simpler in this game where I was introduced 
                                to the 'GetCollisionRecs()' function. This function took in two rectangles as parameters and checked to see if they were overlapping. This 
                                function was used for both the player colliding with the nebulae and the player colliding with the finish line.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The other main thing that I learnt about was handling physics and delta time. If the physics were frame 
                                rate dependent then you can not guarantee that they would behave as expected. For example, if you want gravity to affect an object by one 
                                unit each frame, but then the frame rate doubles for some reason, then gravity is now twice as strong. But making this work using delta 
                                time fixes these issues. Now you can say that you want gravity to affect an object by one unit every second, and it will always affect 
                                said object by the said amount each second.
                            </p>
