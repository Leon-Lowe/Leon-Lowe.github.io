                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hi there! My name is Leon Lowe and I'm a programmer from Sheffield, UK. 
                        My skillset mainly lies in Unity and C#, however I have also experimented with 
                        Python, Unreal, C++, and HTML. I use Unity and C# every day as I'm always looking 
                        to learn new things in the engine. I'm also eager to learn more about the other 
                        languages and engines I have expermented with, as well as learn new languages 
                        such as C and JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>
                        As for my hobbies, I enjoy relaxing with my family (that could be watching a movie
                        with them or going to the park wth my daughter), playing games wth my friends, 
                        and creating games. While playing games, I often find myself wondering how 
                        a dev team has created a certain mechanic and then trying to recreate that 
                        mechanic in Unity. These machnics could be something simple like an inventory, 
                        or something a little more complex like setting player hand positions dynamically 
                        with inverse kinematics.</p>

                    <h2>My Experience</h2>
                    <p>
                        In my time using Unity and C#, I have made numerous public games that you can play 
                        right now. My public games are all in 2D, however I have recently started using 
                        3D as I explore how third and first person games work. You can check those out 
                        on my portfolio page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have also created a couple of mini games using Pyton. In Python I made a 
                        replica snake game (haven't we all?) as well as a game where you need to dodge 
                        asteroids to get a higher score than your previous play through.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've also made a few games in C++, one involving dodging basic primatives, another which 
                        is a sidescroller where you need to jump over obstacles, and the last was just a simple 
                        top down explorer game where you need kill enemies that are on the map. Those games were made 
                        using C++ and raylib. I also made a couple of games using C++ with Unreal. You can check 
                        those out on my portfolio.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've also dabbled with a bit of HTML and CSS. Where's the evidence? You're looking at it! 
                        Everything on this website was made by me in around 16 hours.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But how did I get here? Surely I didn't just jump in and start programming, right? Well if 
                        you're asking that, then you'd be right. I began seriously making games around the age of 14 
                        (2015) using an engone called Clickteam Fusion 2.5. I chose this engine as it was simple to 
                        learn and use, and a rather popular game had been released using it; Five Night at Freddy's. 
                        I used this to make quite a few games until I was 16 which is when I started college. In college 
                        we were using Unity to make games in which meant I had to learn the basics to pass my course. 
                        However, after using Unity for a while, I knew that this was the engine I wanted to use, and C# 
                        was the language I wanted to learn. This drove me to continue learning Unity and C# in my spare 
                        time, and eventually entering multiple game jam's with a college friend who was a pixel artist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After college, I decided to go to Sheffield Hallam University to study Computer Science for 
                        Video Games. While on this course, I began learning C++, however I had to drop out of the course 
                        due to covid-19. After dropping out, I carried on making games in Unity for around a year whilst 
                        working. After this year, I decided it would be good to teach myself Python, C++, and HTML so that 
                        I could expand my knowledge of programming. I also started a tutorial channel on YouTube for Unity 
                        game development.

                    <p>
                        And that leads us to today.
